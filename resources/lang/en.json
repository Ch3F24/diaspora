    "Research Content": "The original concept of the Hungarian Open Air Museum – the plan to present folk architecture and\nhousing culture within our borders - has been expanded in space, theme and time. One of the\nimportant segments of the research of Hungarians living outside our borders has become the\ndocumentation of the way of life of Hungarians living in diasporas. The United States and Argentina\nhave so far become the target countries for diaspora research. Here our museum professionals have\nbeen researching the way of life and habits of emigrant Hungarians and their descendants. We plan to\npresent the results of diaspora research in an exhibition unit, with buildings and interiors, and with\nthematic exhibitions in the future.\n\nIn addition to our staff - Miklós Cseri, Lajos Kemecsi, Ibolya Bereczki, Zsófia Szigethy - Balázs\nBalogh and Ágnes Fülemile have also contributed to the American diaspora research and preparation\nof the exhibition to be realized in the future by focusing on fieldwork, making interviews, photo\nsearches and surveying buildings, as well as collecting objects. Until then we would like to present our\nfindings in the confines of this virtual exhibition.",
